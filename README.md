## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
Befor I started uilding out the app's functionality `js/app.js` was a blank page with few comments on how to proceed (they are still there). But every JS functionality was made on my own. 


## Contributing

This repository WAS the starter code for _all_ Udacity students, and it is my research center. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
