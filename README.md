## Description

This game project was made as a result of Udacity FrontEnd Course task, which checked JS knowledge of students after second part of the course. It had some basic HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.
I had to convert it from a static project to an interactive one. This required some more modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
Before I started building out the app's functionality `js/app.js` was a blank page with few comments on how to proceed (they are still there). But every JS functionality was made on my own.

## Instructions

To play it just match two cards with same symbol on top of them.
The app's functionality has a basic Memory Game functionality, so it opens a cars upon a click, checks and lets to open only 2 cards, when 2 cards match they stay open till the end of the game.
Additional functionality is: Moves counter (1 move = 1 display of the 2 cards), Timer and Stars counter.
Upon matching all the cards, congratulation screen with your results pops up.
